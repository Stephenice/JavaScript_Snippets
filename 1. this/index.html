        this: special variable that is created for every execution context(every
        function).
      </p>
      <p>
        its depend on how the function is called, and its value is only assigned
        when the function is called
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Question 1: </strong> What does its means How the function is
        called?
      </p>
      <p>
        Method(function inside Object): this will point to the Object that is
        calling the method. see code line 10
      </p>
      <p>
        Simple function: this will point to the global Object which is the
        window Object if its not in strict mode but if its will be strict mode
        this will be Undefined. see code
      </p>
      <p>
        this in function expression point to the global object which is the
        window but if its on Strict mode this will be undefined.
