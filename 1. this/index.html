      <p>
        this: special variable that is created for every execution context(every
        function).
      </p>
      <p>
        its depend on how the function is called, and its value is only assigned
        when the function is called
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Question 1: </strong> What does its means How the function is
        called?
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Method(function inside method): this will point to the Object that is
          calling the method. see code line 9
        </li>

        <li>
          Simple function: this will point to the global Object which is the
          window Object if its not in strict mode but if its will be strict mode
          this will be Undefined. see code line 23
        </li>

        <li>
          Arrow function: it doesnt have its own this. lexical this. Even if the
          arrow function is called by Object it will point to the window Object.
          <strong>Note: Dont use Arrow function as Method.</strong>
        </li>

        <li>
          Event Listener: this will point to the DOM element that the handler is
          attached to.
        </li>
        <li>
          Nested Function(inside Method): will be conside as simple function if
          nested. Solution to get this keyword by creating a self variable
          (scope chain). if you nested function is arrow it will get his this
          from the parent scope.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Note: Object is not a block scope and var create a property in the
        global object.
      </p>
      <p>Note: dont use arrow function as a method.</p>
