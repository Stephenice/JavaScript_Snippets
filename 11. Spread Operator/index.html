      <h1>Topic: Spread Operator</h1>
      <p>
        Spread syntax can be used when all elements from an object or array need
        to be included in a list of some kind. used to build array and object
        and to pass multiple values into a function. we use the spread operator
        to expand an array into individual elements.
      </p>
      <p>mostly used in the right side of assignment operator</p>
      <p>
        iterables are: Array, String, Map, Set but not Objects. Most of the
        build in data structure are iterables.
      </p>

      <p>
        when using spread operator in Array you are not manipulating the
        array(not mutating )
      </p>

      <p>
        spread operator work in a place that execpt iterables values separated
        by comma.
      </p>
      <p>
        array-like objects (objects with a length property and indexed
        elements); or iterable objects (objects such as Map and Set).
      </p>
      <p>
        So the spread operator is used where we would otherwise write values,
        separated by a comma. On the other hand the rest pattern is basically
        used where we would otherwise write variable names separated by commas.
